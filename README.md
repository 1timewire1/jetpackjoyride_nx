<h1 align="center">Jetpack Joyride - Nintendo Switch port</h1>

This is a wrapper/port of the Android ARM64 version of Jetpack Joyride (`1.104.1`). <br/>
It loads the original game's ARM64 library and runs it as-is inside a minimal Android compatibility environment.

### How to install

You will need a legally obtained copy of Jetpack Joyride `1.104.1`.

Create `/switch/jetpackjoyride_nx/` on your SD card, copy `jetpackjoyride_nx.nro` there, then extract the complete contents of the APK into the directory.

```text
/switch/jetpackjoyride_nx/
  jetpackjoyride_nx.nro
  lib/
    arm64-v8a/
      libmortargame.so
  assets/
    assets.zip
```

On first boot, the port validates the game data, locates the required library and asset archive, moves them into place, and removes Android files that are not needed on Nintendo Switch.

### Notes

This will not work in applet/album mode. Use a game override (hold R while launching a title) or a forwarder so the game receives the full application memory pool and the required code-memory permissions.

### How to build

You need devkitA64 plus the following devkitPro packages:

* `switch-mesa`
* `switch-libdrm_nouveau`
* `switch-sdl2`
* `switch-zlib`

From an MSYS2 environment with devkitPro mounted at `/opt/devkitpro`:

```bash
./build.sh clean -j4
```

The resulting release build is `jetpackjoyride_nx.nro`.
